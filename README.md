# VG1_Project
We want to create a game centered around something like light. In each level, there is a point light source that can only illuminate a limited area. The goal is to use various devices or tools such as mirrors, portals and so on to direct the light to a specific location, which will trigger different mechanisms and create a path for the protagonist to advance. The concept is somewhat similar to the game 'Where's My Water?'
